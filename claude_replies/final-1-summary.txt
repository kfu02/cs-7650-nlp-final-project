The data table shows the robots starting over 1.2m apart (r0-r1 distance of 1.277 at timestep 1) and around 1.5m from their goals. While the r0 dist to goal, r1 dist to goal, and r2 dist to goal values decrease over time, indicating goal convergence, negative distances emerge for r0-r2 (=-0.021 at timestep 22) and r1-r2 (=-0.037 at timestep 24), signifying collisions between these robot pairs. The robots demonstrate dynamic attention patterns, like r0's r0-r1 attention fluctuating between 0 and 1, while r1's r1-r0 attention is more consistently 1. Though this attention strategy seems useful for navigation, the collisions suggest limitations in learned collision avoidance, especially for r0-r2 and r1-r2 interactions, indicating a need for further policy refinement despite the overall promising goal convergence behavior.
