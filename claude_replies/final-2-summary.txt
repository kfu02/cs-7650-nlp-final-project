The learned robot policies successfully navigated robots 0, 1, and 2 closer to their respective goal zones, with robot 0 reaching 0.042m (timestep 52), robot 1 reaching 0.109m (timestep 52), and robot 2 reaching 0.024m (timestep 52) from their goals. However, a collision occurred between robots 0 and 1, with their distance becoming negative at -0.020521 (timestep 42) and -0.044899 (timestep 43). Initially, the robots paid attention to each other (e.g., attention values of 1.0 at timestep 1), but this attention waned over time. While avoiding collisions with robot 2, the policies failed to prevent the collision between robots 0 and 1, suggesting room for improvement in coordinating movements despite some adaptive attentional behavior.
