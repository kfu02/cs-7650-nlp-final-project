<scenario 2>

Based on the provided table, the following can be interpreted about the learned behavior of the robots:

All three robots (r0, r1, r2) start relatively far away from their respective goals (around 1.2-1.3m for r0 and r1, and 0.9m for r2).
Initially, the robots pay attention to each other (high attention values between robot pairs), suggesting they are accounting for the presence of other robots.
As time progresses, the distances between the robots and their goals decrease, indicating they are navigating towards their respective goals.
Around timesteps 4-9, there is a period where the robots stop paying attention to each other (attention values become 0), potentially ignoring collision avoidance for a brief period.
Around timesteps 26-29, the robots come very close to each other, with the distance between r0-r1 dropping below 0.05m (e.g., 0.014m at timestep 40). This indicates a collision has occurred between r0 and r1.
Despite the collision, the robots continue to make progress towards their goals, with r2 reaching its goal (dist to goal < 0.15m) around timestep 47.
By the end of the timesteps provided, r0 and r1 are still relatively far from their goals (around 0.04-0.05m away), but are paying attention to each other again, potentially to avoid further collisions.

In summary, the robots learned policies that enable them to navigate towards their goals while initially paying attention to collision avoidance. However, there was a period where they ignored collision avoidance, leading to a collision between r0 and r1. Despite the collision, they continued making progress, with r2 reaching its goal. The robots resumed paying attention to each other towards the end, likely to prevent further collisions.
