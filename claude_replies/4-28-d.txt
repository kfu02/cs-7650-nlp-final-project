Based on the provided data, the following observations can be made about the learned behavior of the robots:

Collision: The data shows that at certain timesteps, the distance between some robot pairs became negative, indicating a collision. Specifically:

Robots 0 and 1 collided around timesteps 40-42 (distance became negative)
Robots 1 and 2 collided around timesteps 25-26 (distance became slightly negative)


Goal Proximity:

Robot 0 gradually moved closer to its goal zone, with the distance decreasing from around 1.2m initially to around 0.04m by the end.
Robot 1 also moved closer to its goal, reducing the distance from around 1.2m to around 0.1m.
Robot 2 started relatively close to its goal (around 0.9m) and ended up approximately 0.024m away from the goal.


Attention:

In the beginning, all robots paid attention to each other (attention values of 1.0).
As time progressed, the attention values fluctuated, with robots sometimes paying attention and sometimes not, suggesting a dynamic adjustment of attention based on the situation.
Towards the end, there were periods when robots paid less attention to each other, potentially focusing more on reaching their goals.


Behavior Patterns:

The robots seemed to prioritize moving towards their respective goals while trying to maintain a safe distance from each other.
When the robots got too close, they adjusted their attention and behavior to avoid collisions, but this was not always successful, leading to the collisions mentioned earlier.
The robots' movements became more concentrated towards their goals as time progressed, indicating a learned policy to reach the desired positions.



In summary, the learned policy allowed the robots to navigate towards their goals while dynamically adjusting their attention and behavior to avoid collisions. However, collisions still occurred in some instances, suggesting room for improvement in the learned policy or the need for additional safety measures.
