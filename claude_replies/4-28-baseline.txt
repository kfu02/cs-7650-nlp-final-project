Based on the provided data, here is my interpretation of the learned behavior of the robot team's policy:

Collision Avoidance: For the first 4 timesteps, the robots maintained a safe distance of more than 0.1 meters from each other, indicating successful collision avoidance. However, at timestep 5, the distance between robots 1 and 2 (r1-r2 distance) dropped to 0.3969432217556373, which is less than 0.2 meters (the combined radius of the two robots). This suggests a collision occurred between robots 1 and 2.
Goal Convergence: The data shows that initially, the robots were relatively far from their respective goals. However, over time, the goal distances (e.g., r0 goal, r1 goal, r2 goal) decreased, indicating that the robots were converging towards their goals.
Attention Mechanism: The attention values (r0-r1 attention, r0-r2 attention, etc.) indicate whether a robot was paying attention to another robot. For the first few timesteps, all robots were paying attention to each other, but after timestep 4, the attention values fluctuated, suggesting a more selective attention mechanism.
Velocity Adjustments: The velocity values (r0 vel, r1 vel, r2 vel) show that the robots were continuously adjusting their velocities, likely in response to the positions and movements of other robots and their goals.
Potential Oscillations: In the later timesteps (e.g., 19-21), the robots appeared to be oscillating around their goal positions, as indicated by the small goal distances and velocities.

Overall, the policy learned by the robot team demonstrated the ability to navigate towards their goals while attempting to avoid collisions. However, the collision between robots 1 and 2 at timestep 5 suggests that the collision avoidance mechanism could be improved. Additionally, the oscillations around the goal positions in the later timesteps may indicate room for improvement in the goal convergence behavior.
