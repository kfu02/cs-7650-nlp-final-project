Based on the data provided, here is my interpretation of the learned behavior of the robot policies:

1. Collisions occurred: The table shows negative distances between some robot pairs at certain timesteps, indicating collisions happened. For example, at timestep 40, the r0-r2 distance is -0.02052, meaning robots 0 and 2 collided.

2. Robots moved towards their goals over time: The distances of each robot to its goal (r0 dist to goal, r1 dist to goal, r2 dist to goal) generally decreased over the timesteps, suggesting the robots were navigating towards their respective goal zones.

3. Robots paid attention to each other intermittently: The attention values (e.g., r0-r1 attention) fluctuated between 0 and 1 over time. A value of 1 indicates a robot was paying attention to another robot at that timestep, while 0 means it was not. This suggests the robots were not constantly monitoring each other but did so intermittently.

4. Relative positions of robots changed: The distances between robot pairs (r0-r1 distance, r0-r2 distance, r1-r2 distance) varied over time, indicating the robots were moving and their relative positions were changing as they navigated.

5. Imperfect collision avoidance: While the robots generally moved towards their goals, the occurrence of collisions (as evidenced by negative distances) shows that their learned policies were not perfect at avoiding collisions with other robots.

In summary, the data suggests the robots learned policies that allowed them to generally navigate towards their goals while paying intermittent attention to other robots. However, the policies were imperfect, leading to some collisions occurring during the navigation process.
