Based on the provided data, it seems the robots have learned a policy that initially maintains a safe distance from each other and their respective goal zones. However, as time progresses, they start converging towards their goals, paying less attention to the other robots' behavior.

In the early timesteps (1-4), the distances between the robots (r0-r1, r0-r2, r1-r2) are relatively large, and the attention values are mostly 1.0, indicating that each robot is paying attention to the others. Their distances from the goal zones are also relatively large during this period.

Around timestep 5, the attention values drop to 0.0 for all robot pairs, suggesting they have stopped paying attention to each other's behavior. Concurrently, the distances between the robots and their goal zones start decreasing, indicating they are converging towards their respective goals.

From timesteps 10-15, while the distances between the robots continue to increase (as they move towards their goals), their attention values remain mostly 0.0, except for a few instances where they briefly pay attention to each other.

After timestep 15, the distances between the robots and their goal zones become quite small (< 0.3 m), suggesting they have reached very close to their desired goals. However, the robot-robot distances are also decreasing rapidly, indicating an increased risk of collisions.

Notably, there are no negative values in the robot-robot distance columns, which means no collisions have occurred in the observed data. However, the decreasing distances in the later timesteps suggest a high likelihood of collisions occurring soon if the robots maintain their current policies.

In summary, the learned policy initially prioritizes safety by maintaining distance and paying attention to other robots. However, as the robots approach their goals, they become more focused on reaching their targets and less concerned about potential collisions, increasing the risk of collisions in the later stages of navigation.
