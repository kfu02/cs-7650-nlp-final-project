Based on the provided table, here's my interpretation of the learned policy behavior for the robots:

1. Goal Reaching: By the end of the 51 timesteps, robot 0 (r0) and robot 1 (r1) have not reached their goals as their distances to the goal are -0.10768818132010868 and -0.04061261498691908 respectively. However, robot 2 (r2) has reached its goal at timestep 51 with a distance of -0.1256597041924302 (less than or equal to 0).

2. Collision Avoidance: The table shows that no collisions occurred between any pair of robots throughout the 51 timesteps. All the distance values between robots (r0-r1 distance, r0-r2 distance, r1-r2 distance) remain positive, indicating that the robots maintained a safe distance from each other.

3. Attention Mechanism: The attention values (r0-r1 attention, r0-r2 attention, r1-r0 attention, r1-r2 attention, r2-r0 attention, r2-r1 attention) oscillate between 0 and 1, suggesting that the robots dynamically attend to the behaviors of other robots while navigating. This attention mechanism likely helps them avoid collisions and make progress towards their goals.

4. Behavior Patterns: There are some interesting patterns in the data:
   - Initially, all robots paid attention to each other (attention values = 1) until timestep 4.
   - From timesteps 5 to 9, robots 0 and 1 did not pay attention to each other or robot 2 (attention values = 0).
   - From timesteps 10 to 15, the attention values fluctuated, indicating dynamic attention switching.
   - From timesteps 16 to 25, robots 0 and 1 did not pay attention to each other or robot 2 (attention values = 0).
   - After timestep 25, the attention values showed more frequent switching between 0 and 1, suggesting more active monitoring of other robots' behaviors as they approached their goals.

In summary, the learned policy seems to be effective in avoiding collisions between robots while making progress towards their respective goals. The attention mechanism appears to play a crucial role in facilitating this behavior, allowing the robots to dynamically monitor each other's movements and adjust their actions accordingly.
