Based on the provided data table, I can make the following observations about the learned behavior of the robot policies:

1. Collisions occurred between robots:
- At timestep 42, the distance between robot 0 and robot 1 became negative (-0.020521), indicating a collision between them.
- At timestep 43, the distance between robot 0 and robot 1 was further negative (-0.044899), suggesting they remained in collision.

2. Attention patterns:
- In the initial timesteps, all robots paid attention to each other's behavior frequently, with attention values of 1.0 for most robot pairs.
- As time progressed, the robots started ignoring each other more, with attention values dropping to 0.0 for some robot pairs in certain timesteps.
- However, the robots seemed to resume paying attention to certain other robots intermittently, suggesting some adaptive behavior in response to the evolving situation.

3. Goal distances:
- All three robots started relatively far from their respective goal zones (around 1.2-1.3m) but gradually moved closer over time.
- By the final timesteps, robot 0 was around 0.042m from its goal, robot 1 was around 0.109m from its goal, and robot 2 was around 0.024m from its goal.
- This indicates that the learned policies were able to navigate the robots towards their goal zones successfully, albeit with the collision incident between robots 0 and 1.

4. Robot-robot distances:
- Initially, the robots started reasonably far apart from each other (around 1.4-1.5m).
- Over time, they moved closer to each other, with the distances between certain robot pairs decreasing steadily.
- However, apart from the collision between robots 0 and 1, the other robot pairs managed to maintain a safe distance from each other throughout the episode.

In summary, the learned policies seemed to prioritize reaching the respective goal zones while attempting to maintain a safe distance from other robots. However, the collision between robots 0 and 1 suggests room for improvement in coordinating their movements to avoid such incidents entirely. The attention patterns indicate some adaptive behavior but could potentially be improved further for better coordination and collision avoidance.
