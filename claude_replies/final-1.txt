Based on the provided data table, here are my key observations and interpretations of the learned policies for the robots:

1. Robot-Robot Collisions: The distances between robots r0-r2 and r1-r2 become negative at certain timesteps (22, 24-26), indicating collisions between these pairs of robots. This suggests the policies have not fully learned to avoid collisions in all cases.

2. Goal Convergence: Over time, the distances of all three robots to their respective goal zones decrease, indicating they are gradually converging towards their goals as expected.

3. Attention Dynamics:
    - r0 pays attention to r1 and r2 intermittently, switching between 0 and 1 over different timesteps.
    - r1 pays more consistent attention to r0 and r2, with its attention values mostly being 1.
    - r2 pays attention to r0 and r1 intermittently, similar to r0's behavior.
    This suggests the robots are dynamically adjusting which other robots they need to focus on at different points to navigate effectively.

4. Initial Positions: At timestep 1, the robots start over 1.2m apart from each other and around 1.5m away from their goals, giving them reasonable initial separation.

5. Policy Performance: While the policies allow the robots to generally approach their goals, the occurrence of collisions indicates there is still room for improvement in learning optimal collision avoidance strategies, especially between r0-r2 and r1-r2.

In summary, the learned policies demonstrate promising goal convergence capabilities but still exhibit some collisions, suggesting further refinement may be needed, especially for certain robot pair interactions. The dynamic attention patterns could be a useful strategy for efficient navigation while respecting other agents.
