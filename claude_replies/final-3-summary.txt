The data shows that initially (timesteps 1-4) the robots maintained large distances from each other (e.g. r0-r1 distance of 0.09 at timestep 1) and their goals while paying attention to one another (attention values of 1.0). Around timestep 5, their attention values dropped to 0.0 as they converged towards their goals (e.g. r0 dist to goal of 0.47 at timestep 12). From timesteps 10-15, the robot-robot distances increased (e.g. r1-r2 distance of 1.06 at timestep 15) while their goal distances decreased. After timestep 15, the goal distances became very small (< 0.3 m) but the robot-robot distances also decreased rapidly (e.g. r0-r1 distance of 0.99 at timestep 19), suggesting an increased collision risk despite no negative distance values indicating actual collisions in the data.
